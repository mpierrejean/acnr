# acnr 1.0.0 [2017-04-15]

* Updated data set GSE29172_H1395 by taking only the first 5000 loci of each
  region in order to maintain package size <3Mb.
* Added inst/CITATION.
* Minor updates to doc.

# acnr 0.3.2 [2017-01-06]

* Updated data set GSE13372_HCC1143 to make all regions have a comparable 
  number of data points (0,2) was ~7x bigger than the other ones.

# acnr 0.3.1 [2017-01-05]

* BUG FIX in data set GSE13372_HCC1143: tumor genotypes were mislabeled as 
  normal (Issue #9)
* BUG FIX in data set GSE11976_CRL2324: genotypes were in 0, 1, 2 instead of 
  0, 1/2, 1.
* Added a test to check the consistency of germline genotypes.
* Added other tests to check the internal consistency of all data sets (colum
  names, germline data, region annotation) to address Issues #6 and #8.
* Removed tumor fractions 0.23, 0.45, and 0.47 for which the cellularity is 
  clearly inconsistent with experimental results, see Table 3 in Staaf (2008).
